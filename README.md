# CSC SoftwareEngineering

**Course Description**<br />
 Programming environments and methodologies for the design, development, testing, and maintenance of large  software systems. Student teams will develop a substantial software product from requirements to delivery using  disciplined techniques.<br />


**Learning Outcomes**<br/>
Upon successful completion of this course, you will be able to (partial list):<br />
- Identify, describe, and apply fundamental software engineering terminology, concerns, and practices<br />
- Contribute meaningfully as a team member to a software project throughout the software lifecycle<br />
- Develop technical communication skills used in software engineering including the Unified Modeling Language and the IEEE Software Requirements Specification<br />
- Understand and apply best-practice principles and patterns when designing and implementing software<br />

**IDEA course objectives**<br />
The IDEA “student impressions of teaching” forms you fill out online at the end of the semester identify several more 
general course objectives. In this course, I hope you will benefit in these areas most of all:<br />
- Developing specific skills, competencies, and points of view needed by professionals...<br />
- Gaining a basic understanding of the subject<br />
- Acquiring skills in working with others as a member of a team<br /><br />
